# Logistic-Regression

**Case Study**

This dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had 
heart failure, where each patient profile has 12 clinical features.
This case study attempts to determine the probability of dying 
within 12 months of suffering heart failures. 
We try to determine whether or not 11 regressors determine the 
probabilities cause death within twelve months of heart failure. 

**Findings**

The probability value is very low 7.438494e-13, indicating that the regressors 
used in this study are significant when determining death
within 12 months of heart failure 

There is a 21.0813% causality between the 11 regressors and the 
dependent value of death. I believe it is safe to reject any regressors
that have produced high p-values

The regressors with low p-values indicate that within 12 months of heart failure,
the determining factors in the probability of dying are age, the ability 
the heart to pump blood after a heart failure, the amount of blood 
platelets in the blood stream when the heart is pumping, the amount
serum creatinine and serum sodium in the blood stream.
